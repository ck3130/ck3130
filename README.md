Welcome! I enjoy trying my best to solve problems and learning from my mistakes. I am currently learning more advanced Python coding techniques and intermediate JavaScript, with an emphasis on ReactJS. In addition to those specific languages, I am doing my best to learn more about writing clean, efficient code. 

This repo exists to hold and showcase some of the personal projects I am working on. This can include basic React projects to more involved solutions I have implemented in the real world.
